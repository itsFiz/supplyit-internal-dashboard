## 🍕 Dilution Explained – The Pizza Analogy

### What Happens at Each Round:
- **Before Pre-Seed**: The founders own 100% of the pizza.
- **Pre-Seed**: You slice off 10% and give it to early believers. That slice comes **directly from Fiz and Muhaimin**.
- **Seed Round**: A new investor wants 15% of the *whole* pizza. To fit them in, **everyone’s slice shrinks** proportionally.

> ✅ Seed investors get 15% of the post-money company — not 15% from just the founders. Everyone (including pre-seed investors) gets **diluted together**.

> 🍕 **Key Principle**: Each funding round expands the company, but everyone's ownership % decreases unless they top up.
